# MovieApp
An movie application written in Java after finishing an Android(Java) course with the aim of consolidating the acquired knowledge.

This app uses The Movie Database API, so you should get your own API key to run it.
The API key is required in the MovieDetailViewModel.class for the loadVideos() and loadReviews() methods.
